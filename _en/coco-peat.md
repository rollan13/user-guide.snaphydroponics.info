Coco peat also known as coco coir dust, is a natural spongy material extracted
from coconut husks. It is a by-product of the coconut industry. Among its many
applications is its use in horticulture where it is used as soil a conditioner
or as a soilless growing medium.

They are generally available in garden or agri-vet centers where there are sold as
dehydrated dust in bags or as compressed dehydrated blocks or bricks. Because they have
gone through processing bagged coco peat and coco peat blocks or bricks are
generally sterile.

Coco peat are also available as unprocessed material that are sold in bulk.
Unlike processed coco peat these can possibly contain pathogens and sap which
are both detrimental to plant development.

Sap is present in fresh coco peat. The sap contains plant hormones that stunt
root development. Sap can be removed by allowing it to degrade. A cost effective
way of doing this is by simply leaving a pile of coco peat out in the open where
it will be exposed in rain and sunshine.

Unprocessed coco peat also contains a lot of moisture which makes them host to
harmful bacteria and fungi. Sterilization of unprocessed coco peat is
recommended. Coco peat can be sterilized by boiling it for at least thirty
minutes.
