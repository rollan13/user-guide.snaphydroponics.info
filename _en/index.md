# Important Reminder

SNAP is a low-cost hydroponics system that is easy to setup and easy to maintain.
Growing plants with SNAP is a fun and rewarding hobby or business. However,
before starting, it is important to remember that a suitable location for the
SNAP Hydroponics system is one of the most important factor to consider when
growing plants using SNAP Hydroponics.

In order to grow, plants require sufficient light. In addition, the SNAP Hydroponics
system needs protection from rain. A suitable location for the SNAP Hydroponics
system has the following characteristics:

* receives sufficient sunlight and/or artificial lighting

* is protected from rain

Examples:

* a fully enclosed greenhouse in a sunny location (ideal)

* an area that is covered by a transparent roof in a sunny location (less than ideal)

* an east facing area that receives early morning sunlight and is covered by an
awning (acceptable)

{% include figure.html figure="suitable-snap-location" %}

For total beginners, it is strongly recommended to start with lettuce. Loose
leaf lettuce is recommended during the summer months. Beginners may also start
with other leafy vegetables like <i lang="fil">pechay</i>,
<i lang="fil">mustasa</i> or <i lang="fil">kang-kong</i>.


# Establish Seedlings

## Required Materials

### Sowing Tray

Shallow box or basin with holes for drainage at the bottom. This can be
fashioned out of microwavable containers. Be sure to add drainage holes at the
bottom. It is important that water is allowed to drain off the container,
otherwise seeds or seedlings will sit in water which can cause the seeds to rot
and the seedlings to drown.

It's best to keep the lid since it can be used to keep the moisture in and help
with the seed germination. If the lid is to be used in such a manner, add
aeration holes on them to allow some air to escape and circulate.

{% include figure.html figure="sowing-tray" %}

### Growing Media

There are a number of materials that can be used as growing media for seed raising.
Coco peat is used as growing media in this manual.

Regular potting mixes also work, specially the ones designed for seed raising.
The use of soil that is dug up from the surroundings is not recommended because
it could be contaminated with pests and pathogens.

{% include figure.html figure="coco-peat" %}

[Coco Peat Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/en/coco-peat){:class="btn btn-primary btn-block"}

### Seeds

These can be bought from local garden or agricultural center. For beginners, it
is strongly recommended to start with leafy vegetables such as lettuce, <i lang="fil">pechay</i>,
<i lang="fil">mustasa</i> or <i lang="fil">kangkong</i>.


## Procedure

<ol>
<li>Fill the sowing tray with a layer of moist coco peat around 2.5cm thick (1 inch)</li>

<li>Pack and level the coco peat.</li>

<li>Spread the seeds uniformly and thinly over the coco peat. For reference, a
pinch of small seeds (lettuce seeds for example) contains around twenty (20) to
fifty (50) seeds. Be sure to consider the germination rate of the seeds which
is usually indicated in the seed packets.

{% include figure.html figure="seed-packet-label" %}</li>

<li>Water liberally. How long the seed will take to germinate is usually indicated
on the sowing instructions printed on the seed packet. There are a number of
factors that can affect how long the seeds will take to germinate and the
germination rate. Depending on the freshness of the seeds first signs of
germination usually appear within the next twenty-four (24) to seventy-two (72)
hours with most of the seeds germinating one (1) to two (2) weeks.</li>

<li markdown="1">Grow the seedlings for ten (10) days before transferring to
individual [seedling plugs](#prepare-seedling-plugs).

{% include figure.html figure="germinated-seeds" %}</li>
</ol>

# Prepare Grow Boxes

## Required Materials

### Styrobox

Boxes made of expanded polystyrene (EPS) known commonly as “styrofoam box” or
simply “styrobox” make excellent materials for grow box (or growing box). The
size recommended for use with SNAP Hydroponics is 20"×16"×6". These boxes can
hold 10 (ten) to twelve (12) liters of nutrient solution and has enough room to
grow up to eight (8) leafy vegetables and up to five (5) fruiting vegetables.
Styroboxes of this size are used to transport US imported grapes and are
typically common during the months of September to January.

[Styrofoam Boxes Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/en/styrobox){:class="btn btn-primary btn-block" }

### Lining Material

Styrofoam boxes has ventilation holes running along the edges. In order for the
bottom half of the box to hold the nutrient solution it must be lined with a
sturdy waterproofing sheet. This manual uses 20 ✕ 30 inch polyethylene (PE)
plastic bags.

{% include figure.html figure="pe-plastic-bag-20-by-30" %}


### Styrofoam Puncher
  
A styroform puncher is required to make holes on the upper half of the grow box
for the [seedling plugs](#prepare-seedling-plugs). A tin can of the appropriate diameter
for the seedling plug can be made into such a tool.

[Styroam Puncher Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/en/styrofoam-puncher){:class="btn btn-primary btn-block" }

### Packaging Tape

This will be used to hold the lining material in place and optionally cover the
ventilation holes.

### Bamboo Stick

A bamboo stick or similar implement is used to draw guidelines on the styrofoam.
It is also used to safely remove the styrofoam piece from the styrofoam puncher
after each cut.

## Procedure

<ol>
<li>Flip the upperhalf of the styrobox over and place it on a flat surface. 
Put a piece of plywood or cardboard in between the surface and the styrofoam to
prevent the surface from being damaged by the styrofoam puncher during the
cutting step of the procedure.</li>

<li>Draw guide lines connecting the ventilation holes from opposite sides of the
box as illustrated below. A hole should be made centered where the lines cross.

{% include figure.html figure="guide-lines" %}</li>

<li>To make holes, put the sharp end of the styrofoam puncher on the styrofoam
and apply pressure to score the surface. Hold the tool by the handles and apply
pressure while moving the tool in a clockwise and counter-clockwise direction
making tool cut deeper through the foam. Continue this process until the tool
cuts through the foam.</li>

<li>Pull out the styrofoam puncher carefully. A circular piece of foam will be left on
one end of the tool. Use the stick to safely push one side of the piece into the
tool. This will cause piece to rotate and the other side will be pushed out of the
tool allowing it to be safely extracted.</li>

<li>Repeat this process to create the rest of the holes.

{% include figure.html figure="grow-box-top-bottom-view" %}</li>

<li>It is strongly recommended to use packing tape to cover the ventilation holes
on this half of the styrobox if the growing area does not have protection from
mosquitoes. This will deny mosquitoes access to the nutrient solution and stop
them from breeding in the grow box.</li>

<li>Line the lower half of the styrobox with the PE plastic bag.

# Prepare Seedling Plugs

## Required Materials

### Styrofoam Cups

This guide uses eight ounce (8oz.) styrofoam cups pictured below.

{% include figure.html figure="styro-cup" %}

### Small Hand Saw or Similar

This is used this to cut slits at the bottom of the styro cups.

### Established Seedlings

Please see [section on establishing seedlings](#establish-seedlings).

### Growing Media

There are a number of materials that can be used as growing media. This manual
uses coco peat.

### Plastic Spoon, BBQ Stick or Similar Implements

This is used to uproot seedlings from the sowing tray. This is also used to digging
implement when transferring the seedlings to the seedling plugs.

### Procedure

<ol>
<li>Using a handsaw make four (4) to six (6) vertical slits on the side of the cup
starting from the bottom. It should run two-thirds (2/3) along the side of the cup
and about one-third (1/3) the radius of the bottom of the cup.

{% include figure.html figure="seedling-plug-bottom" %}</li>


<li>Add coco peat to the prepared styro cups. One-fourth (1/4) to one-third (1/3)
the volume of the cup is sufficient—just enough to support the seedling upright.
The lesser the better because the less growing media there is in the cup the
faster it is for the roots to find its way to the nutrient solution.</li>

<li>Transplant the seedlings from the sowing tray to the cups. Use a stick or a
similar implement to uproot the seedlings from the sowing tray with care. “Dig”
a hole in the middle of the growing media in the cup using a stick or similar
implement. Transfer only one seedling per cup. Make the transferred seedling
stand firmly by moving the growing media around the base of the seedling using
a stick.</li>

<li markdown="1">If desired, the seedlings in the seedling plugs can be
*hardened off* before they are transferred to the grow boxes. Let the prepared
seedling plug sit in a shallow pool of diluted working solution for a few days.

{% include figure.html figure="hardening-off" %}</li>
</ol>

# Setting Up the SNAP Hydroponics System

## Materials Needed

### SNAP Nutrient Solution for Hydroponics

The SNAP Hydroponics system requires the use of SNAP Nutrient Solution for Hydroponics.
They are developed, manufactured and sold in IPB-UPLB. They are also distributed
by SNAP Authorized Resellers.

[Authorized Resellers Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/authorized-resellers){:class="btn btn-primary btn-block"}

### Seedling Plugs

Please see [section on seedling plugs](#prepare-seedling-plugs).

### Grow Boxes

Please see [section on grow boxes](#prepare-grow-boxes).

### Clean Water

Deep well and regular tap water works well. SNAP is designed for use with water
from typical water sources in the Philippines. Using water that has gone through
reverse osmosis (*distilled water*) works against SNAP’s working parameters and
the resulting nutrient mixture will not be suitable for hydroponics growing.

### Benches

Optional benches or stand where the grow boxes will be placed under a shelter.

### Shelter

Green house, rain shelter or roof awning facing east for the earliest and
longest sunlight possible.

## Procedure

<ol>

<li>Arrange the grow boxes in the shelter. Make sure that each one is leveled
and each one is receiving sufficient sunlight to support the plants’ growth.</li>

<li>Fill each grow box with 10L of water.

{% include figure.html figure="adding-water" %}</li>


<li>Add 25 mL of SNAP A. Mix well. Add 25 ml of SNAP B. Mix well.
Either SNAP A or SNAP B can be added to the water first but remember to <strong>stir
the mixture thoroughly</strong> in between adding the SNAP A/B nutrient solution. The
resulting mixture is the working solution.

{% include figure.html figure="working-solution" %}</li>


<li>Join the upper and lower halves of the grow box together and make sure they
are properly locked into place.</li>

<li>Insert a seedling plug to each holes on the upper half of the grow box. Make
sure the bottom of the cups is immersed in the solution by at least a centimeter.
If not, add <strong>plain water</strong> until the proper water level is reached.</li>

<li>Examine the boxes for leaks and do troubleshooting.</li>

</ol>
 


# Maintenance of the SNAP Hydroponics System

* Visit the setup every morning as early as possible to catch any insect larva
that may feed on the plants. The larva is active visible in the early morning.
After that they tend to hide and are harder to find.

* Expect slow plant growth in the first two weeks after the seedlings have been
transplanted. This is specially true if the seedlings has not been hardened off.
In this first couple of weeks the plant is adjusting to water logged conditions.

* After the first couple of weeks the plants will show vigorous growth. Most leafy
crops will be of marketable size during in third week onward.

* Expect the working solution level to go down as the plants grow. The level will
go down faster as the plants grow.

* Replenish the solution when the working solution level becomes too low. **Never**
allow it to totally dry up. When replenishing the solution, **never** allow
the level of the solution to reach the bottom of the cup and submerge all of the
roots. The upper half of the plants’ roots must always be exposed to air and
thus not be submerged in water. Always observe this practice when replenishing
the contents of the grow box.

* Crops that needs replenishment but are close to harvest are replenished with
plain water.

* Crops that needs to be grown for over a month are replenished with fresh working
solution.
