Grow boxes or growing boxes are an essential part of the SNAP Hydroponics
system. The grow box acts as a reservoir for the SNAP
[working solution]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/working-solution). The grow box also holds
the seedling plugs in place. This is an easy to follow step-by-step guide
on how to properly construct grow boxes from used styrofoam boxes (styrobox).

## Required Materials

### Styrobox

Boxes made of expanded polystyrene (EPS) known commonly as “styrofoam box” or
simply “styrobox” make excellent materials for grow box. The size recommended
for use with SNAP Hydroponics is 20"×16"×6". These boxes can hold 10 (ten)
to twelve (12) liters of nutrient solution and has enough room to grow up to
eight (8) leafy vegetables and up to five (5) fruiting vegetables. Styroboxes
of this size are used to transport US-imported grapes and are typically common
during the months of September to January. For details please see
[the styrobox guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/styrobox).

### Lining Material

Styrofoam boxes has ventilation holes running along the edges. In order for the
bottom half of the box to hold the nutrient solution it must be lined with a
sturdy waterproofing sheet. In this guide we’ll use 20 ✕ 30 inch polyethylene
(PE) plastic bags.

### Styrofoam Puncher

A styrofoam puncher is required to make holes on the upper half of the grow box
for the seedling plugs. A tin can of the appropriate diameter for the seedling
plug can be made into such a tool. For details please see this
[guide on making DIY styrofoam puncher]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/styrofoam-puncher).

### Packaging Tape

This will be used to hold the lining material in place and optionally cover the
ventilation holes.

### Bamboo Stick

A bamboo stick or similar implement is used to draw guidelines on the styrofoam.
It is also used to safely remove the styrofoam piece from the styrofoam puncher
after each cut.

## Prepare the Styrobox

Although styrofoam grape boxes are of the same size, the way their upper and
lower halves are designed to fit together are different depending on the
manufacturer and the manufacturer’s type designation. This means the upper and
lower halves of the styrobox won’t fit properly if they are not of the same type.

The styrobox has a locking tabs to keep it shut. To open the box press on the
lower half at the middle of one of the shorter side to release the lock then
pull the upper half away.

It is recommended to wipe down the styrobox with a clean rag to remove dust,
grease and/or moisture, because these can cause tape, which we will be using
to hold the plastic liner in place, to fail.

## Work on the Upper Half of the Grow Box

Turn the upperhalf of the styrobox over and place it on a flat surface. It is 
recommended to put a piece of plywood or cardboard in between the surface and
the styrofoam. This is to prevent the surface from being damaged by the
styrofoam puncher as it cuts through the styrofoam.

Draw guide lines connecting the ventilation holes from opposite sides of the
box as illustrated below. A hole should be made where the lines cross.

To make holes, put the sharp end of the styrofoam puncher on the styrofoam and
apply pressure to score the surface. Hold the tool by the handles and apply
pressure while moving the tool in a clockwise and counter-clockwise direction 
making tool cut deeper through the foam. Continue this process until the tool
cuts through the foam.


Gently pull out the styrofoam puncher. A circular piece of foam will be left
at the cutting end of the tool. Use the stick to safely push one side of the
piece into the tool. This will cause the piece to rotate and the other side be
pushed out of the tool allowing it to be safely extracted.

Repeat this process to create the rest of the holes.

It is strongly recommended to use packing tape to cover the ventilation holes
on this half of the grow box if the growing area does not have protection from
mosquitoes. This will deny mosquitoes access to the working solution and stop
them from breeding in the grow box.

## Work on the Lower Half of the Grow Box

Start by preparing pieces of packing tape roughly 3 inches long. Position the
20 ✕ 30 plastic liner as shown below. Since the box is 20" ✕ 16" in size, the
plastic liner should exceed the length of the box by 5 inches on both ends and
exceed the width of the box by 4 inches on both sides. These measurements makes
it easy to center the plastic liner on the lower half of the grow box.

{% include figure.html figure="plastic-liner-over-lower-grow-box" %}

Fold both ends of the plastic liner as shown below.

{% include figure.html figure="plastic-liner-with-ends-folded" %}

Fold both sides of the plastic liner allowing the plastic liner to fit and “fall
through.”

{% include figure.html filename="plastic-liner-with-sides-folded" %}

At this point the edge of the plastic liner should be flush along the length of
the grow box. Tape them in place at the center of the length of the grow box as
shown below.

{% include figure.html figure="plastic-liner-with-sides-taped" %}

Add tape on the same sides of the grow box but towards the corner as shown below.
Note how the tape only holds the side flush edge of the plastic liner and not the
folded part of the adjacent side.


{% include figure.html ifgure="plastic-liner-with-corner-taped" %}

Repeat for the rest of the corners.

{% include figure.html figure="plastic-liner-with-all-corners-taped" %}

With the plastic liner fixed into position by tape, grab the folded ends of the
plastic liner and pull it towards the side of the grow box. The plastic liner
will make a triangular shaped fold at the corners.

{% include figure.html figure="plastic-liner-end-positioned" %}

With a helping hand or with the use of clip to hold the plastic in place, tape
the ends of the plastic liner to the side of the grow box. Tape the corners
first then tape the center. Note that the plastic exceeds the height of the grow
box’s wall along its width and the plastic will go over the side of the styrobox
as you tape it in place. Repeat this process on the opposite side.

The grow box is now complete.

## Remove the Locking Tabs (Optional)

The upper half of the styrobox has tabs that locks it in place on top of the
lower half. When the grow boxes are packed close together this locking mechanism
can make it difficult for you to open the grow box to examine what’s inside.
They can optionally be removed by cutting them off with a box cutter.
