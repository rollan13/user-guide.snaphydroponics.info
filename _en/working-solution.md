The mixture of water and SNAP Hydroponics Nutrient Solution for Hydroponics A
at SNAP Hydroponics Nutrient Solution for Hydroponics B is called the working
solution. Below are the steps on how to to prepare it.

## Prepare Clean Water

Start with ten liters (10L) of clean water. Water from regular sources like tap
water, well water, etc., works well. The use of pure rain water and pure
distilled (reverse osmosis) water is discouraged because pure rain water and
pure distilled water has a neutral pH. Preparing the working solution from
water with a neutral pH will result in a solution which has a pH that is too
low to properly support plant growth.

**Note: If using water from regular water sources, there is no need to monitor
the pH.**

## Add SNAP Nutrient Solution

Add 25mL of SNAP A and <strong>mix well</strong>. Add 25mL of SNAP B <strong>mix well</strong>.
The order by which SNAP A and SNAP B is added does not matter. However, it is
important to mix the solution well before adding the next SNAP solution. <strong>Do not</strong>
not to mix SNAP A and SNAP B together before adding them to water. Mixing SNAP A
and SNAP B will cause them to react with each other which will render the solution
ineffective.
