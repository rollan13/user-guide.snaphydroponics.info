Styrofoam boxes that are used to make grow boxes comes in different sizes. The
size recommended for use in SNAP Hydroponics measures 20 ✕ 16 ✕ 6 inches. Styrofoam
boxes of these sizes are used to transport imported grapes from the United States
and come from two manufacturers: Styrotek LLC and Aptco. LLC. They also come
in different designs which means that one has to remember that although their
sizes are similar their upper and lower halves are does not fit upper and lower
halves of other designs.

There is also a seasonal influx of styrofoam boxes for imported grapes. They are
typically abundant during the months of September to January because these are
the months that the Philippine market imports them for the holiday season. Their
availability peaks during late December and early January. So much so that they
litter the streets in some places. These are the times to try to find and collect
them. Outside of these months they are typically harder to find. 

These styrofoam boxes can be arranged so that they fit a 1m ✕ 1.2m area. This is
the size of a standard transport pallet. This arrangement can be utilized to
maximize the growing capacity of an area.
