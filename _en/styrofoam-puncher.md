The SNAP Hydroponics system utilizes a grow box to contain the nutrient
solution and hold the seedling plugs in place. One of the steps in making
grow boxes is to add the holes on the upper half of the styrobox where the
seedling plugs would fit. One of the ways to accomplish this is with the use
of a do-it-yourself (DIY) tool made of empty tin cans.

## Materials


### Empty Tin Can

An empty tin can with a 3-inch diameter. These are pretty common since tin cans
follows standard sizes. To verify if the holes made with a tin can will fit
the styro cup, fit them to the can itself as demonstrated in the picture below.

The use of tin cans with ribbing along the side is recommended. The ribbing
adds lateral stiffness of the can and allows it to hold its circular structure
even when the lip of the cut has been cut off to sharpen the cutting edge.


### Bamboo Sticks

A pair of bamboo sticks or other materials strong enough to serve as handles
for the tool. For bamboo sticks, it is recommend to make a pair of them by
dividing a single half inch thick bamboo stick into a quarter inch pair by
splitting the stick along the grain. It should be long enough to run along
the diameter of the tin can and have around 3 inches protruding from the sides
of the can. Make sure to smooth out the edges as well as the cut ends of the
bamboo sticks to remove splinters and sharp edges.

Using a single piece of bamboo saves time and effort. However, the rocking
motion this tool will experience during use will ruin it pretty fast. The handles
will exert pressure on the holes where they go through the can. The sides of the
can is very thin and soft. The pressure exerted by the bamboo stick will be enough
to enlarge it and pretty soon it will be too large for the tool be useful.
Sandwiching the lid with two pieces of bamboo lashed together will transfer the 
force to the lid which will be able to handle these forces.

### Rubber Band

Rubber band or other materials that can lash the pair of sticks together. A
sturdy length of string or fishing line works too.

## Equipment

The lip at the open end of the tin can needs to be cut away in order to produce
a sharp cutting edge. A pair of tin snips is required in order to do this.

A piece of bamboo stick with a pointed end is also required. It will be used to
add holes on the sides of the can where the handles will go through. It should
be around 3–5 inches long with the same cross section as the material that will
be used as handles.

A knife or a bolo to work with the bamboo and the tin can; and a can opener to
completely open one end of the tin can are also required.

## Procedure

Start by using a can opener to completely open one end of the tin can.

Then using a knife or bolo add “T” shaped cut on one side of the can near the
closed end. This “T” shaped cut will make sure that the hole will be centered
and even when enlarged using the pointed bamboo stick implement.

Using our bamboo tool, enlarge the “T” shaped cut to make a larger hole. Use any
appropriately sized tool to hammer it through the can.

The “T” shaped cut makes sure that the hole enlarges evenly and stays centered
as shown in the picture below. Repeat this process on the opposite side of the
can.

Push one of the bamboo sticks through the holes previously made. Make sure it is
centered so that the length of the handles are even. Put the other half on top
and so that the lid of the can is sandwiched between the pieces of bamboo. 
Then lash them together tightly with a rubber band or string.

Lastly, if preferred, the cutting edge of the tool can be sharpened by cutting
off the lip of the open end of the can. Although this step can be performed
before any other steps, it is recommend to do this last because the cut edge
is indeed sharp. It is sharp enough to cut through skin. The other steps performed
on the tin can will have a risk of giving someone a cut if they are performed
with the lip of the can removed exposing a sharp edge.
